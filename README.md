📘 What I Learned

I made this web application because I wanted to learn more about databases and authentication, which was helpful and interesting at the same time.

I learned to think more logically and systematically when designing features, structuring code, and debugging. This project helped me bridge the gap between theoretical programming knowledge and practical application, applying it in real life rather than just through normal exercises
